# Pairs
HTML + CSS + JavaScript game. Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. This is a personal exercise to improve my knowledge of web development. Please, forgive any errors.
