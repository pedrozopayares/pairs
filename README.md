# Pairs
HTML + CSS + JavaScript game. Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. This is a personal exercise to improve my knowledge of web development. Please, forgive any errors.

## Structure
This game is made using HTML tags and CSS styles to create the cards, and CSS animations to implement the flip cards effect. JavaScript is used to create the Game object and control the logic. JSON files help to load configurations.
